## Project Euler Math Challenges


From the [Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net/) main page - 
```
Project Euler is a series of challenging mathematical/computer programming problems that will require more than just mathematical insights to solve. Although mathematics will help you arrive at elegant and efficient methods, the use of a computer and programming skills will be required to solve most problems.

Only intend to work on these in between other projects / learning different things and will stop when bored, or I find something else.

Aiming to complete each challenge using both Python & Javascript.

Challenges are separated into folders, one folder per challenge, and named in numerical order to match the challenge.

A list of all challenges can be found on the sites [archives section](https://projecteuler.net/archives).
